# Baggage-Complaints
Final Project for Applied Time Series Analysis Course (ADS506) at the University of San Diego

Teammates: Sowmiya Kanmani Maruthavanan and Benjamin Ogle

Description:
The primary objective of this analysis is to analyze and leverage the baggage complaint data collected over time for 3 airlines, and to provide recommendations to reduce the number of complaints. 

Results: 
This analysis elicited that baggage complaints are highest during the summer months and year-end months. Additionally, there were significant positive correlations identified between the number of canceled flights and the number of complaints per individual. Therefore, it is recommended that greater efforts are put in place to reduce the number of last-minute canceled flights through methods like more conservative scheduling or proactively performing maintenance on airplanes to reduce cancellations due to technical mistakes. To quantify the potential reduction in baggage complaints, business stakeholders are encouraged to run the provided models on simulated data that contains a lower number of canceled flights; this way, the cost tradeoff of different solutions can be compared. Another recommendation is to allocate additional resources to baggage handling during the peak travel months when there is a higher potential for bags to be mishandled. This could be performed by hiring additional temporary staff during these months, or scheduling employees more hours during peak travel months and less during the slow months.
